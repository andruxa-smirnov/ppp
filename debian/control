Description: Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) daemon
 The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) provides a standard way to transmit
 datagrams over a serial link, as well as a standard way for the machines
 at either end of the link (the "peers") to negotiate various optional
 characteristics of the link.  Using PPP, a serial link can be used to
 transmit Internet Protocol (IP) datagrams, allowing TCP/IP connections
 between the peers.
 This daemon has bug fixes beyond the ppp-2.4.4 release
 (mainly in the area of Master/Slave link recovery).
